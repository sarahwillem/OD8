When Drupal code or documentation refers to "assets" this generally means CSS
and/or JavaScript files. Sometimes images and icons are grouped in, as well.

This theme places all of its assets in a folder called "assets" though this is
not a requirement of Drupal. Files can be organized in any folder structure,
because these files are always referenced using their full path within the theme
folder.

It is common to place all CSS in a folder called "css," all JavaScript in a
folder called "js," and all images in a folder called "images."
